> This section will give you some information regarding this application. But **if you are in a survival situation right now** - please **skip this** blurb and jump directly to the section that contains the information for your immediate problem/need.

This app is intended to guide you in rough times but it can also be used to have fun outdoors and to learn things that are useful even outside a survival situation. The fun parts are also useful in training important skills for potential survival situations. Reading is only one factor - practice and understanding are also needed to increase your chances of survival.

The app is based on the FM 3-05.70 Field Manual - but now [it is a wiki](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual/wiki) (think of it as the Wikipedia of survival) so it is easy to improve the content. That said when you see something that can be improved, or if you find that something is missing, step up and improve the content!

Also, if you are able to illustrate: I am currently adding new sections and am unable to illustrate. E.g. the new section on [Power](Power) could use some images of wind and water generators (for example). It is important to keep the images small - ideally they will be vector images - but black & white images as the other ones in this app also work. The file-sizes should be small so that people do not uninstall their Survival App to make space and forget to re-install it later. This app should always be less than 10Mb in size so people can just keep it on their phones without really worrying about it.

There will be updates to content and the app - please [join the BetaTesters](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.ligi.survivalmanual) to give feedback and get the newest stuff first.

Thanks to everyone that made this app possible! You can find some of them [in the credits](Credits).

If you want to support this app: please rate it and maybe have a look at the support options on [my homepage](http://ligi.de) or get some of the survival equipment you still need via my Amazon affiliate links (like the [Solar USB Charger](SolarUSBCharger), [Lifestraw water filter](LifeStraw), [Leatherman OHT MultiTool](OHTMultiTool))
If you already have everything and no money you could get the [free audible trial](Audible) and e.g. listen to the great audio book "the Martian". This is a beautiful survival story from another planet!

Also on a personal note: Please let's work towards a future where such a manual is not needed that much. Let's protect the environment and stop all wars so humans are not forced to go through bad times and need to fight for survival. Let's just live in peace in a beautiful, intact world!-)

That said, happy surviving - live long and prosper! With the hope that you never get in such trouble that you really need this guide, have fun preparing for potential situations and learning.
